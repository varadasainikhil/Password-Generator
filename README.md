# Password-Generator
This is a password generator built using python. 
We can specify the number of letters, symbols and numbers we want in our password.
There are 2 versions of the password generator. The first one has a fixed order that is letters followed by symbols followed by numbers, but the random-order one has no order and all the characters are shuffled.
